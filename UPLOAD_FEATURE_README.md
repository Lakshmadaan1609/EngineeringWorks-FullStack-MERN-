# Image Upload Feature Implementation

## Overview
The dashboard has been updated to support file uploads instead of URL inputs for product images.

## Changes Made

### Server-side Changes (`server/index.js`)
1. **Added multer dependency** for handling file uploads
2. **Created uploads directory** - automatically created if it doesn't exist
3. **Configured multer storage** with:
   - Unique filename generation
   - 5MB file size limit
   - Image file type validation
4. **Added file upload route** (`/api/upload`) with authentication
5. **Added static file serving** for uploaded images
6. **Added error handling middleware** for upload errors

### Frontend Changes (`src/pages/admin/components/ProductModal.jsx`)
1. **Replaced URL input** with file input
2. **Added file preview** functionality
3. **Added upload progress** indicator
4. **Added file validation** and error handling
5. **Added memory leak prevention** with URL.revokeObjectURL
6. **Updated form submission** to handle file uploads

### Authentication Changes (`src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
1. **Added token persistence** in localStorage
2. **Added automatic token retrieval** on app initialization

## Features
- ✅ File upload with drag & drop support
- ✅ Image preview before upload
- ✅ File type validation (images only)
- ✅ File size validation (5MB limit)
- ✅ Upload progress indicator
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Automatic cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ Authentication required for uploads

## Usage
1. Navigate to the admin dashboard
2. Click "Add Product" or edit an existing product
3. Click "Choose File" to select an image
4. Preview the image before saving
5. Click "Save Product" to upload and save

## File Storage
- Images are stored in `server/uploads/` directory
- Files are served statically at `/uploads/filename`
- Unique filenames prevent conflicts
- Original file extensions are preserved

## Security
- Only authenticated users can upload files
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- File size limits prevent abuse
- Unique filenames prevent path traversal attacks
